### *Frequency events _ exp1* (16/02/24 )
#### By Anthuanet Falcon & Albert Vila :)

This is the documentation of our exploration and reflection on our first micro challenge, based on our inspiration drawn from Albert and Anthu. It is rooted in the search for new ways to understand the language of nature and its expression within the environment.

#### *Secret Languages Vol1. It is possible to see the frecuencies and vibrations 

This idea emerges from the fusion of perspectives within the scientific, artistic, and technological realms, challenging current methods of research and exploration in the natural world. Our inspiration and curiosity to delve into the natural language through observation led us to understand that the language of our environment is often imperceptible to our human species. The reasons extend beyond the anthropocentric mindset and include physiological factors.

#### Patterns Visible and Invisisble
When we speak of the languages of nature, we refer to the fusion of the visible and the invisible. Among natural patterns, we highlight fractals, spirals, tessellations, and symmetrical shapes commonly observed in leaves, shells, animal skins, and geological formations. These are shaped by languages invisible to humans, such as frequencies, waves, vibrations, microwaves, energy, heat, etc.

In this initial exploration, we chose to focus on vibrations and frequencies, drawing inspiration from the study of Cymatics through the Chladni plate.
 
*Cymatics is the science that studies the graphic representation of sound, and it emerged by attributing a creative meaning to sound.*

Who is Ernst Chladni

He was a German physicist known for his work on vibrations and the calculation of the speed of sound for different gases, and is considered the founder of acoustics. The geometric patterns that appear formed by fine layers of sand deposited on a glass or metal plate that is vibrated at different frequencies are called 'Chladni sound figures.


#### Our References : Links, papers, videos....

One of our initial references is the artist *Nigel John Stanford*, who explores Cymatics by creating interactive systems between vibrations, percussion instruments, frequencies, etc., and various elements such as water, salt, sand, and fire.

 We also explored various ways to create our own Chladni plate, starting from low-tech, which was our initial intention, and later incorporating electronic elements. Here are our reference, Make you own Chladni Plate!

## Propose (What is supposed to do or not to do in this 1st Micro challenge)

During this stage, our goal is to create a dataset of sounds by experimenting with different frequencies. Subsequently, through our mentioned electronics, we aim to transfer these sounds to our speaker, allowing us to visualize the patterns they generate with our elements.

This exploration holds aspirations to further develop in the upcoming challenge, incorporating ideas involving machine learning and the exploration of additional elements.

 
### Elements

# INPUTS

For this microchallenge 1 we have decided to focus on the outputs using our own inputs so we have  left the data capture for another challenge.

After some tests with music we decided to download some pure frequencies and create tracks of 1 minute each. We used the https://onlinetonegenerator.com/ to create pure sine frequencies of the desired frequencies.

After some tests with the balloon-speaker we added some low frequencies (10,20,40,50)


# PROCESSING SYSTEM

## ELECTRONICS FOR TESTING OUR OUTPUTS

For provide the sound/vibrations to our different outputs we have use a DF Player that is a module that provides a integrated MP3 player with a minisd card

## DF Player datasheet

Download the whole datasheet: [https://github.com/RalphBacon/MP3-Player-DFPlayer/blob/master/DFPlayer Mini Manual.pdf](https://github.com/RalphBacon/MP3-Player-DFPlayer/blob/master/DFPlayer%20Mini%20Manual.pdf)

The configuration we used the following diagram that works without any coding.

# OUTPUTS

In order to explore diferent visualizations and the limits of each one we have worked in 3 different outputs. The Chladni plate, a vibrating ballon membrane and a laser balloon. After the first iterations with the first output we decided to made some variations.

## Output 1: Chladni plate

# CONCLUSIONS AND NEW IDEAS

1. This is just the beginning​! 
2. Our intentions were ambitious, such as merging vibrations with water and laser.
3. We want to begin interpreting the patterns in the next challenges
4. When using sensors, interfaces or artifacts to translate signals the very nature, composition and shape of this “devices” affects the initial signal.
5. We want to explore more with Water and Bio materials as well. 
6. This type of micro challenges is a good way to learn but a little stressful.
7. We want still Explorer this systems and add more ideas , so see u in the second Challenge!!
8. Hopefully that we can communicate with another "Living beings" using our system.(lol) :)))))))))
9. I like work with Albert 
10. I like work with Anthu



# THANKS TO MICROCHALLENGE SUPPORTING TEAM AND TO THE CLASSEMATES, ESPECIALLY FLORA AND MANUJA FOR THE ANNOYING SOUNDS!!!!!!!!!!
