#    Nature patterns languages : Secret Languages
### *Frequency events _ exp1* (16/02/24 )

#### By Anthuanet Falcon & Albert Vila :)

This is the documentation of our exploration and reflection on our first micro challenge, based on our inspiration drawn from Albert and Anthu. It is rooted in the search for new ways to understand the language of nature and its expression within the environment

#### *Secret Languages : Frecuencys and Vibrations 

This idea emerges from the fusion of perspectives within the scientific, artistic, and technological realms, challenging current methods of research and exploration in the natural world. Our inspiration and curiosity to delve into the natural language through observation led us to understand that the language of our environment is often imperceptible to our human species. The reasons extend beyond the anthropocentric mindset and include physiological factors.

#### Patterns Visible and Invisisble
When we speak of the languages of nature, we refer to the fusion of the visible and the invisible. Among natural patterns, we highlight fractals, spirals, tessellations, and symmetrical shapes commonly observed in leaves, shells, animal skins, and geological formations. These are shaped by languages invisible to humans, such as frequencies, waves, vibrations, microwaves, energy, heat, etc.

In this initial exploration, we chose to focus on vibrations and frequencies, drawing inspiration from the study of Cymatics through the Chladni plate.
 
*Cymatics is the science that studies the graphic representation of sound, and it emerged by attributing a creative meaning to sound.*

Who is Ernst Chladni

He was a German physicist known for his work on vibrations and the calculation of the speed of sound for different gases, and is considered the founder of acoustics. The geometric patterns that appear formed by fine layers of sand deposited on a glass or metal plate that is vibrated at different frequencies are called 'Chladni sound figures.


#### Our References : Links, papers, videos....

One of our initial references is the artist *Nigel John Stanford*, who explores Cymatics by creating interactive systems between vibrations, percussion instruments, frequencies, etc., and various elements such as water, salt, sand, and fire.

 We also explored various ways to create our own Chladni plate, starting from low-tech, which was our initial intention, and later incorporating electronic elements. Here are our reference, Make you own Chladni Plate!
